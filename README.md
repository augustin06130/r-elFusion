# üé¨ Auto-Shorts Generator ‚Äì Fully Automated TikTok / Reels / Shorts Creation from Any Theme

**Auto-Shorts Generator** is a fully automated pipeline for creating short-form videos (TikToks, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels) from a **single theme input** like `horror`, `sci-fi`, or `history`.

Powered by Reddit, multilingual TTS (`xtts-v2`), and AI video editing tools, this project transforms viral Reddit content into engaging, ready-to-publish short videos **with subtitles in multiple languages** ‚Äî in just one click.

---

## üß† How It Works

1. **Theme Input**: You provide a theme (e.g., `horror`)
2. **Content Scraping**: The script fetches the top post from the relevant subreddit (e.g., `/r/horror`) using Reddit's API
3. **Text Processing**:
   - Parses long-form posts or comments into coherent narrative
   - Translates the story into multiple languages
   - Breaks the text into speech-friendly segments (1‚Äì1.5 min per segment)
4. **Voice Generation**: Uses [`xtts-v2`](https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v2) for zero-shot multilingual voice synthesis
5. **Video Creation**:
   - Downloads a relevant background video from YouTube
   - Crops it to vertical (9:16) format
   - Adds the voiceover and generates matching subtitles
6. **Output**:
   - Multiple videos (1 per language)
   - All videos are export-ready for TikTok, Shorts, and Reels

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:augustin06130/r-elFusion.git
cd r-elFusion
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> This includes `huggingface_hub`, `praw`, `moviepy`, `openai`, `yt_dlp`, etc.

### 3. Download the Voice Model

Run this script to automatically download the [`xtts-v2`](https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v2) model hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/):

```bash
cd xtts-v2_Docker_API
python download_model.py
```

This will create a local folder `xtts-v2-model/` with the necessary voice model files (\~1.8 GB).

## üîä XTTS-v2 Voice Model

This project uses **XTTS-v2** for high-quality, zero-shot, multilingual voice generation. Due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit, the model is hosted on **[XTTS-v2](https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v2)** and is automatically downloaded using the script below:

### `download_model.py` (included in the repo):

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
import os

model_dir = "xtts-v2-model"

if not os.path.isdir(model_dir):
    print("Downloading XTTS-v2 model from Hugging Face...")
    snapshot_download(
        repo_id="https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v2",
        repo_type="model",
        local_dir=model_dir,
        local_dir_use_symlinks=False
    )
    print("Model downloaded.")
else:
    print("Model already present.")
```
